> Je souhaite faire un jeux vidéo en 3D de type RPG médiéval avec un thème trés cartoon et humoristique.

Creating a 3D medieval RPG with a cartoon and humorous twist is an exciting project! Here's a structured approach based on your thoughts:

### Title and Characters
- **Title**: "Les Aventures de Sir Bernoulli et ses Amis"
- **Characters**:
  - Sir Bernoulli: Brave but clumsy knight.
  - Marguerite: Clever, sassy princess.
  - François: Quirky druid.
  - Élodie: Warrior from another planet with sci-fi humor.
  - Roland: Robot paladin with a funny twist.

### Storyline
- **Plot**: Sir Bernoulli is tasked by Marguerite to stop theDark Wizard Zogorath. The goal is to retrieve the Codex Arcanus, which has randomized magical effects. The story ends with Sir Bernoulli becoming ruler but aspiring to be a chef, adding a humorous twist.

### Game Overview
- **Visual Style**: 3D, vibrant colors, exaggerated animations, and a comic book feel using cell shading.
- **World Design**: Vast open world with diverse biomes (castles, forests, deserts, floating islands) for exploration.
- **Gameplay**: Turn-based combat with real-time elements, skill combinations for unpredictability, and crafting that ties into cooking mechanics.

### Technical Aspects
- **Tools**: Use Blender for modeling and Unity/Unreal Engine for development.
- **Audio**: Compose an upbeat soundtrack and hire voice actors for comedic dialogue. Use freesound.org for sound effects.

### Community and Marketing
- **Community Engagement**: Create a Discord for feedback, share updates on social media, and release a pre-alpha demo.
- **Marketing**: Produce a funny trailer, engage with indie communities, and consider a Kickstarter for funding.

### Budget and Platforms
- **Budget**: Allocate funds for voice actors and composers, possibly crowdfund for resources.
- **Release Platforms**: Start with indie platforms like itch.io, expand to Steam and consoles later.

### Additional Considerations
- **Humor and Replayability**: Ensure humor is consistent and include secret gags for replay value.
- **Core Features**: Focus on storytelling, core mechanics, and character development before expanding.

### Next Steps
- **Prototype**: Begin with a basic prototype to test core mechanics.
- **Character Design**: Develop character sketches and ensure they are visually appealing and consistent with the theme.

By following this structured approach, you can bring your vision of a humorous medieval RPG to life. Good luck with your project!
