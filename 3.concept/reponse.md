## Concept Art Prompts for Characters and World Design

### **Overall Style**
- **Medieval Fantasy Cartoon Aesthetic**: Bright, saturated colors, exaggerated features, and whimsical, playful designs.
- **Comedic Visual Language**: Silly expressions, absurd proportions, and humorous details (e.g.,Sir Bernoulli’s overly large shield or Marguerite’s sassy posture).
- **Accessibility**: Ensure designs are clear and easily recognizable, even in small or pixelated forms.

### **World Design Prompts**

#### **Overworld Prompt**
- A vibrant, medieval fantasy world with rolling hills, a medieval castle on a hill, a forest with glowing mushrooms, and a floating island in the distance. All elements have a cartoonish, exaggerated style. The sky is bright blue with floating clouds shaped like medieval helmets or shields. The ground is a mix of grass, dirt paths, and cobblestones.
- Add a sense of humor: a mischievous fox wearing tiny armor, a farmer with a comically large carrot, or a knight walking a magical, multi-colored chicken.

#### **Medieval City Prompt**
- A bustling medieval city with towering wooden houses, thatched roofs, and a central market square filled with vendors selling funny items (e.g., a stall selling "enchanted spaghetti" or "magic potion of invisibility"). The city walls are made of wooden planks and have a lopsided tower with a comical knight peering out.
- Add quirky details: a cat riding a broomstick, a giant tomato growing on a vine from a roof, or a water wheel spinning with fish wearing tiny hats.

#### **Forest Prompt**
- A whimsical forest with giant talking mushrooms, trees with faces carved into their trunks, and a river filled with glowing, playful fish. The ground is covered in leaves, and there’s a small, comically oversized stone bridge in the foreground.
- Add humor: a bird wearing a tiny wizard hat, a patch of flowers that spell out "HI" in a cartoony font, or a tree stump with a tiny door leading to a hidden world.

#### **Castle Prompt**
- A massive, slightly dilapidated castle with uneven towers, ivy crawling up the walls, and a drawbridge that looks like it’s about to collapse. Inside, the castle has a great hall with a comically long table, a throne that’s too big for the current ruler, and a spiral staircase made of mismatched materials.
- Add humor: a suit of armor with a funny expression, a giant cauldron in the kitchen bubbling with strange, colorful ingredients, or a talking portrait that’s mid-sneeze.

#### **Magic Shop Prompt**
- A cluttered, magical shop with shelves filled with potion bottles in all shapes and sizes, sparkles in the air, and a counter with a crystal ball that’s "on sale." The shop owner is a quirky, old wizard with a mischievous grin and a mix of modern and medieval props (e.g., a bowler hat, a wand, and a spellbook shaped like a smartphone).
- Add humor: a broomstick flying around the room, a sign that says "Objects May Be Stolen for Your Safety," or a potion labeled "Instant Love Spell," with a price tag of "One Şilver Coin or One Heart."

### **Character Design Prompts**

#### **Sir Bernoulli (Protagonist Knight)**
- A brave but clumsy knight in mismatched armor. His shield is too big, and his sword looks like it’s been sharpened one too many times. His helmet is slightly askew, and he has a big, goofy grin. Add a funny expression or pose that shows his awkwardness (e.g., tripping over a pebble or holding a giant frying pan instead of a sword).
- **Color Palette**: Earthy tones for his armor (brown, gold, and silver), with green and red accents for his cape.

#### **Marguerite (Princess and Ruler)**
- A regal, sassy princess wearing a stylish crown, a flowing dress with floral patterns, and mismatched accessories (e.g., one shoe slightly higher than the other). She has a confident, almost smug expression and carries a tiny magic wand or sword. Add details like a necklace with a chip in the gemstone or a slightly crooked tiara.
- **Color Palette**: Rich purples and blues for her attire, with gold and pink accents.

#### **François (Druid Friend)**
- A quirky druid with a patchy beard, mismatched hat, and a staff that seems to have a life of its own (e.g., vines crawling up it or a tiny animal peeking out from the top). He wears a tunic made of leaves and has a friendly, goofy smile. Add humorous details like a raccoon companion or a bag filled with strange, glowing herbs.
- **Color Palette**: Earthy greens and browns, with bright yellow highlights.

#### **Élodie (Warrior from Another Planet)**
- An alien warrior with a mix of medieval and futuristic armor. Her armor is sleek but covered in strange, glowing patterns. She has large, buggy eyes and a mix of antennae, feathers, or other whimsical features. She carries a weapon that looks like a cross between a sword and a laser gun.
- **Color Palette**: Bright blues and purples, with silver and gold accents.

#### ** Roland (Robot Paladin)**
- A comically overengineered robot knight with gears, pipes, and glowing lights. His armor is mismatched (e.g., one arm made of wood and the other made of metal). He has a serious yet goofy expression, as if he’s trying hard to be a proper knight but keeps messing things up. Add details like a tiny bird sitting on his shoulder or a gear sticking out of his helmet.
- **Color Palette**: Bright reds, blues, and silvers, with highlighted yellow and orange accents.

### **Villains & Minions**
- **Dark Wizard Zogorath**: A towering, comically evil wizard with wild hair, a long, pointy beard, and robes covered in strange runes. His hat has a tiny dragon chewing on the brim, and his staff looks like it’s emitting sparks in a dangerous way. His eyes glow with mischief.
- **Zogorath’s Minions**: Include funny, quirky creatures like:
  - Skeletons wearing mismatched armor and carrying comically tiny weapons.
  - Goblins with exaggerated features (e.g., giant ears, tiny hats, and silly grins).
  - Animated broomsticks that look.temperature

### **Other World Design Elements**
- **Magical Creatures**: Include whimsical creatures like:
  - A dragon with a giant pacifier in its mouth.
  - A flying pig wearing a tiny pilot’s helmet.
  - A forest filled with talking animal allies (e.g., a rabbit in a tiny knight’s armor or a mouse with a tiny sword).
- **Music and Sound**: While not visual, think about how the music and sound design will complement the cartoony, humorous style. Perhaps a mix of medieval instruments with a modern, quirky twist.

### **Final Tips for Concept Art**
- **Consistency**: Keep the style consistent across characters and environments to maintain the game’s cohesive visual identity.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure characters and environments are easy to recognize, even at smaller scales.
- **Color Palette**: Use vibrant, contrasting colors to make the world feel lively and inviting.
- **Humor in Every Detail**: Add subtle jokes and absurd details to every piece of concept art, from the characters’ costumes to the props in the environment.

By focusing on these prompts, you’ll create a world that feels immersive, fun, and true to the cartoony, humorous spirit of *The Funky Codex Quest*. Good luck with your concept art creation!
